### Story

#### Opening story:

##### Mushroom Kingdom
Mario and the rest beat Bowser. They return with their balloons to Peach's castle, where they land safely. Everything seems to be finally over when suddenly Mario starts to laugh maliciously. He turns around and grabs one of the two Toads and throws him down a cliff. Everyone is frozen in shock and only reacts when Mario has already grabbed the second Toad.

Peach and Luigi try to stop Mario, but it's too late.

Mario turns and looks in the direction of Peach and Luigi, who panic when a black portal suddenly appears, from which Rosalina's voice comes out: "Flee! This way! Hurry!!!"

Luigi and Peach jump into the portal which closes as soon as they pass through. Mario is enraged, but can't do anything else.

##### Rosalina's Observatory

When Luigi and Peach land on the other side of the portal they find themselves in Rosalina's Observatory where Rosalina and Baby Luigi awaits them. At the same time Daisy is jumping out of another portal.

When everyone calmed down a bit, Rosalina reports of an unusually large crack in the space-time continuum that she noticed a few days ago near the Mushroom Kingdom. Since then, she has been observing the situation there. Of course, the significant victory over Bowser did not escape her attention.

When she heard Mario's malicious laughter, she quickly realised that something must be wrong. She ordered the Lumas to open a portal to Peach and Luigi to save them. As the situation seemed dire, Baby Luigi, who visited Rosalina and the Lumas beforehand, asked her to open an additional portal for Daisy. However, they were unable to teleport more than the three newcomers present, as this consumed all the energy of the Observatory. As a result, the Observatory is falling apart.

Now it is up to Peach, Daisy, Luigi and Baby Luigi to find out what happened and to protect the world from a new threat.



As the Observatory fell apart, the group can only take a look at the situation in the Mushroom Kingdom at the end of World 1 where they reach a telescope. It turns out that Mario has thrown the entire Mushroom Kingdom into chaos. Toads find themselves grown in trees while their energy is sucked out of them (cf.: Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time). Bowser's former minions aren't better off either. Several species have been forced to eat Super Crowns or Super Bells. Others were banished or exterminated completely. Only Boos were partially left alone. Furthermore, Shadow Marios and Shroobs can be sighted ...

##### Important preceding information

The game will have 8 "Normal Worlds", 4 "Bonus Worlds" and 8 "Special" versions of the Normal Worlds (cf.: Super Mario 3D Land).

After Mario is defeated, King Boo will come out of his body. He maligioucly laughs a few seconds and returns into Marios body. He then flees from the stage and the level ends. This doesn't end the game though: King Boo flees to a place out of reach for the players. If all 4 Bonus Worlds are found and completed the 8 Secret Worlds will be unlocked. If none or not all of the Bonus Worlds are found so far, an notice about their existence and importance for the game is to be given. Once every Bonus World as well as the fight against Mario in the Normal Worlds is completed, an notice about the Secret Worlds is to be given and the first Secret World will be unlocked.

In the 8 Normal Worlds only the normal storyline is told. Therefore Mario is shown up to here as the enemy, who is responsible for everything. 

The 4 Bonus Worlds are to be hidden in the 8 Normal Worlds (examples: Library in a mountain on Yoshi's Island behind a waterfall; behind a mountain, where the camera will turn 180Â° when one enters the world, so that one can look behind it; 2 bonus worlds still have to be placed). In the Bonus Worlds the Bonus World storyline is to be told.

The 8 Special Worlds on the other hand tell about the future plans of King Boo and the Shroobs. Once unlocked, it will be possible to switch between the Normal and Special Worlds by pressing B on the wiimote while on the map. The Bonus Worlds won't be accessible from the Special Worlds as there won't be "Special Bonus Worlds".

When switching between the Normal Worlds and Special Worlds, textures and background objects should change. Also the Special Worlds have to be unlocked one after another just as the Normal Worlds. The levels of the Special Worlds will be slightly more difficult versions of the respective levels of the Normal Worlds. Additionally the so called hardmode is activated: less time and each hit means immediate death.

##### Story told in the Bonus Worlds:

Bowser died a long time before the fight between the four original heroes (the two Toads, Luigi and Mario) in a battle with King Boo. The latter took over Bowser's now lifeless body after his victory.

When Bowser was later defeated, Mario, who scored the final hit, was also at the end of his rope. Taking advantage of this moment, King Boo took over Mario's body unnoticed by everyone and sealed Mario's memories and consciousness.

This is all part of a long-planned attack that was planned and executed through collaboration between Shroobs and Boos. The larger crack in the space-time continuum that Rosalina noticed was the result of a large-scale teleportation of countless Shroobs.



##### Story told in the Special Worlds:

King Boo has captured Bowsette. She is a relative of Bowser, who, unlike Bowser, has dedicated herself to scholarly research. Her greatest passion is said to be the largely unexplored celestial bodies. 

King Boo believes that with her knowledge, he will become able to regain possession of the Dark Moon and expand his power even further.

Bowsette refuses to cooperate because she has learned that Bowser has been killed by King Boo, a former ally. But the question is how long she will be able to hold out. Once King Boo has possession of the Darkmoon, all hope is lost.







##### The end of the game

Mario once again gets defeated. This time though, when King Boo comes out of Mario, Rosalina  teleports Mario's body out of the level. King Boo has no choice and flees yet again. This time a level will appear where he left to previously. In this level the final fight against King Boo and the Shroobs will take place.

Bowsette will be rescued just like Peach was in the original game. Since Mario, unlike Bowser, did not die before being taken over by King Boo, it's possible to bring him back to life.

At the end Bowsette tells about a hidden place where King Boo and the Shroobs can be sealed. It's World 9 just as in the original game where Peach tells about an additional world. World 9 won't have a Normal and a Special Version just as the Bonus Worlds. The levels in World 9 will be unlocked once every starcoin in every level in each Normal and Special World is collected (more or less as in the original game). Once all starcoins, including those of the Bonus Worlds and World 9, are collected, the final fight level will appear in the Normal World 8 as well. It won't be another boss fight but instead an extremly difficult level as a final challenge for the player. This level marks the end of the game.
